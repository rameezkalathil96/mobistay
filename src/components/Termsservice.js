              Hello and welcome! We are glad that you are taking the time to
              read these terms of service (the “Terms”). These Terms are
              important as they, together with your booking confirmation email
              (the “Booking Confirmation”), set out the legal terms on which
              booking Services are made available to you through our Service.
              They also cover any interactions or communications you have with
              us through our Service. Your use of our Service is conditioned
              upon your acceptance of these Terms. To book a Service, you must

              please do not use our Service or book a booking Service.
